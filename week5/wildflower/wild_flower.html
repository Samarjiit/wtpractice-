        A wildflower (or wild flower) is a flower that grows in the wild, meaning it was not intentionally seeded or planted. 
        The term implies that the plant probably is neither a hybrid nor a selected cultivar that is in any way different from the way it appears in the wild as a native plant, even if it is growing where it would not naturally.
         The term can refer to the flowering plant as a whole, even when not in bloom, and not just the flower. </p>
